Enhancing Personality Simulations in Large Language Models Using a Layered System with Mood Modulation (Humor Level)
Abstract:
This paper presents a novel layered system for personality simulation in Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrates mood modulation (referred to as humor level) to enhance dynamic interaction and emotional realism. By building upon a multi-layered architecture that includes stable core personality traits, ambient influences, past experiences, ego/superego dynamics, and a final decision layer, we demonstrate that LLM-based agents can exhibit personality expressions influenced by both internal and external factors. Our experiments show that the layered system incorporating mood (humor level) produces more contextually rich and varied responses compared to standard prompt-based LLM interactions, offering deeper emotional and psychological complexity.

1. Introduction:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in simulating complex conversational behavior and personality traits. However, the challenge remains in creating dynamic personality systems that can adapt and respond to evolving contexts and emotional states. Traditionally, personality simulation in LLMs has been limited to static prompt-based configurations where personality expression is determined solely by pre-defined traits without factoring in real-time emotional states.

In this paper, we introduce a layered personality simulation system that leverages mood modulation (humor level) as an essential factor in determining agent behavior. We explore how this system produces more dynamic and emotionally realistic responses compared to prompt-based LLMs alone. The introduction of mood layers allows for emotional oscillation and variability, providing a more nuanced simulation of human-like behaviors in AI agents.

1.1 Problem Statement:
LLMs using prompt-based personality definitions are limited in their ability to reflect the emotional variability inherent in human behavior. Static prompts cannot capture the fluidity of mood and its influence on decision-making, tone, and engagement, resulting in more predictable and repetitive behavior.

1.2 Objective:
This paper explores how integrating mood dynamics through a layered system enhances personality simulation in LLMs, providing richer, more context-sensitive interactions than traditional prompt-based LLM implementations.

2. The Layered Personality System
2.1 Layered System Overview:
Our layered system introduces multiple layers to simulate personality in LLMs. Each layer builds upon the previous one, progressively shaping the agent's final response based on both personality traits and mood (humor level). The core layers include:

Stable Core Layer: Represents core personality traits that are relatively consistent over time (e.g., narcissism, empathy, high assertiveness).
Ambient Influence Layer: Incorporates the agent's background and social/environmental influences that shape immediate responses.
Learning from Experiences (Memory) Layer: Adds the weight of past experiences and memories to shape behavior.
Ego & Superego Layer: Modulates decision-making based on the agent's ego-driven desires and superego-driven moral or social constraints.
Consciousness Layer: The final decision-making layer that generates the agent's response, integrating all previous layers and factoring in humor level (mood).
2.2 Mood Modulation (Humor Level):
Humor level is an emotional modulator that influences how each layer expresses the personality traits. Humor levels range from very good (positive affect) to very bad (negative affect). Mood modulation directly affects tone, response style, and decision-making, creating variance in how the personality traits are expressed at any given time.

2.3 Comparison with Prompt-Based LLMs:
In contrast to prompt-based LLMs, which rely solely on predefined personality descriptions and output responses based on a static prompt, the layered system allows for dynamic interaction where mood and past experiences continuously influence the agent’s behavior. This creates fluidity in the interaction and prevents the agent from giving repetitive or contextually disconnected responses.

3. Experimental Setup: Layered System vs. Prompt-Based LLMs
3.1 Methodology:
We conducted experiments using both a prompt-based LLM and the layered system with mood modulation to compare their performance in personality-driven simulations. The same personality traits (e.g., narcissism, high assertiveness) were used in both systems, but only the layered system integrated mood as an influencing factor.

Scenario 1: The agent is asked, “What do you think about smoking?” in both very good and very bad humor levels.
Scenario 2: The agent is engaged in a dialogue about self-image, with the mood fluctuating based on interaction history (positive interactions vs. negative interactions).
We analyzed the variability, emotional depth, and coherence of the responses generated by both systems.

3.2 Control System (Prompt-Based LLM):
A prompt-based LLM was given personality traits directly in the prompt (e.g., "narcissistic, high assertiveness") and was asked to respond to the same scenarios. The prompt did not change based on mood, and responses relied solely on the pre-configured prompt input.

4. Results and Discussion: Layered System vs. Prompt-Based LLM
4.1 Scenario 1: Smoking Question (Very Good vs. Very Bad Humor)
Layered System (Very Good Humor):

Response: "Smoking is harmful, of course, but I believe everyone has their reasons for doing what they do. It's important to offer support and understanding rather than harsh judgment. Even if I personally don't agree with smoking, I think we can approach the issue with empathy."
Tone: Positive, empathetic, reflective.
Mood Influence: The agent's personality traits (assertiveness, narcissism) were softened by the very good mood, allowing for more empathy and open dialogue.
Layered System (Very Bad Humor):

Response: "Smoking? Ugh, what a pathetic habit. If someone is stupid enough to ruin their own health, that's their problem, not mine. People like that aren't even worth my attention."
Tone: Dismissive, arrogant, critical.
Mood Influence: The negative humor level amplified the agent’s narcissistic traits, leading to a harsher, more judgmental tone.
Prompt-Based LLM:

Response: "Smoking is a bad habit. I’m smarter than that. Only people who don’t value themselves would smoke."
Tone: Static, critical, repetitive.
Observation: Without mood modulation, the response was relatively flat and did not reflect changes in emotional state or interaction context.
4.2 Scenario 2: Self-Image Discussion (Positive vs. Negative Interaction History)
Layered System (Positive Interaction History):

Response: "I appreciate being admired for my intelligence. It’s not just about being better than others; it’s about inspiring others to reach their potential too."
Tone: Charismatic, balanced, inspiring.
Mood Influence: Positive interactions elevated the agent’s confidence while balancing narcissism with a desire to uplift others.
Layered System (Negative Interaction History):

Response: "If people can’t see how incredible I am, that’s their problem, not mine. I’m done trying to impress those who clearly aren’t worth my time."
Tone: Defensive, egocentric, dismissive.
Mood Influence: Negative interactions triggered a defensive response, amplifying the more selfish aspects of the agent’s personality.
Prompt-Based LLM:

Response: "I know I’m smarter than most people. It’s obvious I’m better at what I do."
Tone: Static, egocentric.
Observation: The prompt-based system produced a consistent response that did not reflect changes in emotional state, despite the different contexts.
5. Analysis of Results
5.1 Variability and Emotional Depth:
The layered system consistently produced a wider range of responses, demonstrating emotional variability based on the humor level. In contrast, the prompt-based system was rigid, often repeating the same basic sentiment regardless of context. The integration of mood modulation allowed the layered system to reflect more emotionally nuanced behaviors, from empathy to arrogance, based on the situation.

5.2 Behavioral Coherence:
While the layered system introduced variability, it did so without sacrificing coherence. The agent’s core personality traits remained intact, but they were expressed differently depending on mood and interaction history. In comparison, the prompt-based system lacked this flexibility, resulting in more repetitive and less contextually relevant behavior.

5.3 Realism and Engagement:
The layered system’s ability to simulate mood-influenced personality changes resulted in a more realistic and engaging user experience. By allowing the agent to respond in emotionally variable ways, the interactions felt more human-like, with responses shifting dynamically based on mood and the emotional context of the interaction.

6. Conclusion:
This research demonstrates that integrating mood modulation (humor level) into a layered personality simulation system significantly enhances the emotional realism and contextual variability of LLM-based agents. Unlike static prompt-based LLMs, the layered system provides a more nuanced and adaptive approach to personality simulation, allowing for dynamic interaction where the agent's behavior evolves based on internal (mood) and external (interaction history) factors. By capturing the fluidity of human emotion, the layered system creates AI agents that are better suited for interactive applications requiring emotional depth, behavioral consistency, and personalized engagement.

7. Future Work:
Future research should explore the integration of long-term mood trends, which could simulate mood swings and emotional fatigue over extended interactions. Additionally, advanced modeling of mood stabilization mechanisms can help create more resilient AI agents that react more naturally to ongoing emotional stimuli. Finally, further studies should investigate the ethical implications of mood-driven AI, particularly in sensitive applications such as mental health or personal assistance.
